# Programming-Exercises
Details my process of learning about and completing various programming challenges

Each file will contain a programming problem I have found, and some solutions or attempts at solutions, and a write up of what I have learned during the process. Through this exercise, I hope to show both my thought process in a software development setting, and improve as a developer.


During the solving of these challenges, I will **not** view any official solutions until the conclusion of my attempts. The official solutions will be listed at the end of each problem, and what I learned from them.

Happy reading!
